        This simple timer was made using Allegro 5 library and writing in C++. It is one of the first programs which
        Paulinek
        wrote. So if you have noticed a bug - please report it to the
        author. Moreover, feel free to criticise any unprofessional mistakes in the code. Anyway, Paulinek hopes you
        will
        not experience any problems and Paulinek is open to new ideas related with the app.

        Enjoy!
