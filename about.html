        This simple timer was made using Allegro 5 library and writing in C++. It is one of the first programs which
        Paulinek
        wrote. So there are probably some mistakes in code or bugs (BTW: If you have had one - please report it to the
        author). Anyway, Paulinek hopes you will not experience any problems.
